SQUPluginSystem
===============

A simple plugin system for OS X.

Plugins are simply bundles with a custom extension. The plugin system is currently in use by an app in development. There's some code for an example plugin included â€” it demonstrates how to provide a preference view, store preferences and how to do two-way communications between app and plugin. Of course, it also teaches you a little about Scripting Bridge.
