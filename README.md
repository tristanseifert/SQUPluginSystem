SQUPluginSystem
===============

A simple plugin system for OS X.

Plugins are simply bundles with a custom extension. The plugin system is currently in use by an app in development. There's some code for an example plugin included â€” it demonstrates how to provide a preference view, store preferences and how to do two-way communications between app and plugin. Of course, it also teaches you a little about Scripting Bridge.

To show a possible real-life application of this plugin system, there's a single test app for you to test all your plugins in. When opened, it will try to load all plugins in it's application support folder, as well as the app bundle's PlugIns folder. The plugin mentioned earlier is included in the app, so you can see how it works. Here's a screenshot of it:
